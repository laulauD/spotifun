Girl group project, using React for the first time ! It was a rush, so we had just 2 days to do it.

If you wanna see, you can enter in my_app 

```cd my_app```

and enter in react-front ! 

```cd react-front```

In react-front, you can do 
```npm install react```
 
 and do 
 
 ```npm start```
 
 Now go to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy !
